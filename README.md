# port-type

> Categorize port numbers by semantics.

## Why?

 - Helps you screen user input.
 - Identify port ranges by name.
 - Can tell you if it is possible to start a server.

## Install

```sh
npm install port-type --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.
```js
const portType = require('port-type');
```

Identify the [type of port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_port "Explanation of distinct port categories.") you are working with, as a lowercase string.

```js
const input = 123;
portType(input);  // => "system"
```

But why type all that and still have to do a [strict equality check](http://www.impressivewebs.com/why-use-triple-equals-javascipt/ "Explanation of why you should always use triple equals over double equals in JavaScript.")? Fuggedaboutit.

```js
const input = 123;
portType.isSystem(input);  // => true
```

There are other types, too.

```js
const input = 4444;
portType.isSystem(input);      // => false
portType.isRegistered(input);  // => true
portType.isDynamic(port);      // => false
```

There are a few handy dandy method aliases because I love you and I don't want you to be sad.

````js
const input = 123;
portType.isWellKnown(input);  // => true, same as isSystem
portType.isPrivate(input);    // => false, same as isDynamic
````

Still wondering what these are exactly? They are simple number ranges, which determine how different sets of ports should be used. You can get the definition of each range, too.

```js
const input = 4444;
portType.ports.system.MIN;     // => 0
portType.ports.registered.MAX  // => 49151
```

But a better way is to ask with some sugar on top.

```js
portType.min('system');      // => 0
portType.max('registered');  // => 49151
```

Eventually you will want to determine if it is even remotely possible or sensible to try to listen on a port.

```js
const input = 80;
portType.needsRoot(input);   // => false on Windows, true everywhere else
portType.haveRights(input);  // => true on Windows, false everywhere else unless running as root
```

Isn't that warm and cozy? Just look at it.
